DeepT-HybridXGB: Deep Learning for Predicting Tumor T cell Antigens
This project presents a machine learning framework to classify protein sequences as "Positive" or "Negative". The project utilizes a hybrid feature extraction method that combines two different approaches:

Deep Features: Semantic and structural features (embeddings) are extracted from protein sequences using ProtBERT-BFD, a powerful protein language model.

Chemical Features: 365 different physicochemical features are calculated for the proteins, including amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, and polarity, based on the iTTCA-RF method implemented in ittcaChemicalFeatures.py.

These two feature sets are combined ("hybrid features") to train and evaluate several classification models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost.

ðŸš€ Models and Results
Multiple models were trained and tested to find the best-performing approach. The final results on the test set are as follows:

Model Name	Features Used	Test Accuracy
iTTCA-RF (Random Forest)	Chemical Features Only	~86%
DeepT-i (Inception CNN)	ProtBERT Deep Features Only	~87%
DeepT-Hybrid (Inception CNN)	Hybrid (ProtBERT + Chemical)	~88%
DeepT-Hybrid-XGB (XGBoost)	Hybrid (ProtBERT + Chemical)	~90.7%

The best performance was achieved by the DeepT-Hybrid-XGB model, which leverages the combined power of deep and chemical features with an XGBoost classifier.

Installation & Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed. You can create a requirements.txt file and install them using the command pip install -r requirements.txt.

requirements.txt

tensorflow
torch
transformers
xgboost
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
shap
keras-tuner
visualkeras
pydot
graphviz
Alternatively, you can install the libraries individually:

Bash

pip install tensorflow torch transformers xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib shap keras-tuner visualkeras pydot graphviz
Required Files
To train and test the models, the following 4 files must be present in the project's root directory (the same location as the .ipynb files):

ittcaChemicalFeatures.py: A Python script containing the functions for extracting 365 physicochemical features based on the iTTCA-RF method.

TrainSet.txt: A text file in a FASTA-like format containing the protein sequences for training. Each sequence header must include a Positive or Negative label.

TestSet.txt: A text file containing the protein sequences for testing.

PAAC.txt: A file containing the "Pseudo Amino Acid Composition" (PAAC) parameters, which is required by ittcaChemicalFeatures.py for the feature extraction process.

Usage
The project is provided in three Jupyter Notebook files:

DeepT_Hybrid.ipynb (Recommended):

This is the main notebook containing all the experiments mentioned above. It allows you to run and compare every model from a single file.

DeepT_Hybrid_Inception.ipynb:

This notebook focuses specifically on the Inception-based CNN models (DeepT-i and DeepT-Hybrid-Inception).

DeepT_Hybrid_XGB.ipynb:

This notebook focuses on the XGBoost model (DeepT-Hybrid-XGB) and includes SHAP analysis for feature importance.

Steps:

Install the required libraries listed above.

Upload ittcaChemicalFeatures.py, TrainSet.txt, TestSet.txt, and PAAC.txt to your Google Colab or Jupyter environment, placing them in the same directory as the notebooks.

Open your preferred notebook (we recommend starting with DeepT_Hybrid.ipynb).

Execute all cells sequentially (Run All).

The results (accuracy, AUC score, classification reports) will be displayed in the output of the corresponding cells.
